# This file defines a set of executables (a "service") that will be controlled by TrayAppControl
#
# DO NOT USE TAB characters, it is prohibited by YAML standard! USE spaces instead
#
# DO NOT USE double-quotes (") and single backslashes (\) **TOGETHER** for paths! It will lead to errors
# USE either C:\path\path OR 'C:\path\path' OR "C:\\path\\path"
#
# It is recommended to use absolute paths with extensions (i.e. C:\httpd\bin\httpd.exe, not ..\httpd\bin\httpd )

service-name: Example Service
icon-running: C:\path\sample\running.ico
icon-stopped: C:\path\sample\stopped.ico

# if true, the service will be started immediately on TrayAppControl start
# if false, you have to manually start it via context menu
start-immediately: false

# if true, the service will be stopped when TrayAppControl app is being closed
#    (either per user request or on shutdown/reboot/logout)
# if false, the service will be left "as is"
stop-on-shutdown: true
# NOTE: do not rely on this feature, it is not guaranteed that it will work in 100% cases
# NOTE: no error messages will be displayed ever on shutdown


# these apps will be "managed" by TrayAppControl, i.e.
# on "Start" action these app will be started and their process handles will be "remembered", 
# so on "Stop" action their processes will be terminated
